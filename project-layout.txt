Number buttons have to display number on results box as they are click
- numbers are added to stack
Operation buttons have to add operation to stack
- Functions for:
    - add
    - subtract
    - multiply
    - divide
Equal button will run stack and perform operation
Delete button will pop off stack
Clear button will remove everything from stack

Operation indexes will always match with number indexes, so if multiply occurs, 
take the index before and after that operation and apply it to numbers
then perform the equation
delete those numbers and operation from the array
continue until arrays are empty
SO LONG AS OPERATIONS ARE NOT IN SEPARATE CONTAINER
